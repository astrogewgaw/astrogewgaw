I am Ujjwal Panda, a research student currently employed at the [**N**ational **C**entre for **R**adio **A**strophysics (**NCRA**)][ncra]. I work on developing both offline (processing data after it has been recorded from the telescope üíæ) and real-time (processing data as it comes in ‚ö°) pipelines for the [**G**MRT **H**igh **R**esolution **S**outhern **S**ky (**GHRSS**)][ghrss] survey. [**ffapipe**][ffapipe], a pipeline I developed to search for slow pulsars using the **F**ast **F**olding **A**lgorithm (**FFA**) in 2019, is now up on GitHub, with an associated paper in the works üòÅ !

I am currently working on the following projects:
  
1. [**DeDisp.jl**][DeDisp.jl]: An implementation for the dedispersion algorithm in Julia.
2. [**koshka**][koshka]: A TUI for radio transient catalogs. Written in Go.
3. [**priwo**][priwo]: Read in and write out pulsar data in various formats. Written in pure Python.
4. [**pataka**][pataka]: Simulating pulsars and FRBs. Written in pure Python.
5. [**whoswho**][whoswho]: Contact list for astrochemists from around the globe. Made via Lowdefy.
